In a file a set of linux commands will exicute sequencially to get an output is known as shell script.

The file should starts with
#!/bin/bash

we have differnet types of variables in our shell script
those are
local variables
Environment variables


where as local variales will pass in the scrippt file itself only.these files will called as chaild shell
Where as environment variables are pass from main shell(parent shell) to chaild shell i.e when the varible pass into a file from outside.environment variables can't pass to a file from chaild shell to parrent shell.

example for local variables
name="srinivas"
age=30
city="hyderabad"

environment variables
export name="srinivas"
export age=30
export city="hyderabad"
